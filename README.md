# Learnings
I wanted to practice new concepts either from studying for or problems from tech interviews.  I tried to apply concepts to semi-real world problems so it could be more applicable.  Hope this helps someone as much as it helped me.

### [Calendar Free Meeting Times](https://github.com/vcobar/learnings/blob/master/Recursion/CalendarDay.js)
        A class that determines which hours are free given an array of arrays with scheduled times.
        Limits: 0 <= hour <= 24

**Example**
```
Input: [[7,8],[8,9],[11,12],[14,16]]
Output: [[0-7],[10,11],[12,14],[16,24]]
```
